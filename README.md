# Breast-Cancer-Data-Analysis
***Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis Project***

Welcome to our final group project for the CISC 4631 Data Mining course in Spring 2023. Our team consists of five members who are passionate about data mining and using it to solve real-world problems. In this project, we will be analyzing the Breast Cancer Dataset to identify patterns and relationships in the data, as well as to make predictions about future outcomes. We aim to draw conclusions and make recommendations for how the healthcare industry can use this information to improve breast cancer treatment and outcomes. We will also discuss the limitations of our analysis and potential areas for future research.

**Dataset**

The Breast Cancer Dataset contains data on breast cancer patients, including features such as age, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node status, and more. This dataset is widely used in the healthcare industry and is available on the internet. We will be using Python, one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis, to process and analyze this dataset.

**Data Processing**

Before performing data mining techniques, we first processed the data to ensure that it is clean and ready for analysis. This involves a comprehensive data cleaning process, which includes checking for missing values, dealing with outliers, and performing feature engineering as needed. 

**Data Mining Techniques**

We will use various data mining techniques, such as classification, clustering, and association rule mining, to analyze the Breast Cancer Dataset. These techniques will help us to identify patterns and relationships in the data, as well as to make predictions about future outcomes. 

**Performance Evaluation**

To evaluate the performance of our data mining techniques, we used various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also performed cross-validation to ensure that our results are reliable and robust. We used visualization techniques to communicate our findings effectively and make it easier for the audience to interpret the results.

**Final Findings**



**Submission**

We will make our project code and documentation available on GitHub, where anyone can view our work and see our commitment to open-source practices.

**Grading Policy**

Our grade for this project will be based on the quality of the project (80%) and the performance of teamwork (20%). We will ensure that we meet all project requirements and exceed expectations. We will also use this project as an opportunity to learn and grow as data scientists and work towards building a successful career in this field.

Thank you for taking the time to review our project. We hope that you find our work as insightful. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or comments.
