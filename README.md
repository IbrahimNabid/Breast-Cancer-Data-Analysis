# Diabetas-Data-Analysis
***Diabetas Dataset Analysis Project***

Welcome to our group project on using data mining and machine learning to improve Diabetas treatment and detection. Our team consists of five members who are passionate about data mining and using it to solve real-world problems. In this project, we will be analyzing the Diabetas Dataset to identify patterns and relationships in the data, as well as to make predictions about future outcomes. We aim to draw conclusions and make recommendations for how the healthcare industry can use this information to improve diabetas prevention and treatment. We will also discuss the limitations of our analysis and potential areas for future research.

**Dataset**

 We will be using Python, one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis, to process and analyze this dataset.

**Data Processing**

Before performing data mining techniques, we first processed the data to ensure that it is clean and ready for analysis. This involves a comprehensive data cleaning process, which includes checking for missing values, dealing with outliers, and performing feature engineering as needed. 

**Data Mining Techniques**

Our group has started working on a Diabetas Dataset containing patient information and diabetas outcomes. We have performed cross-validation of different classification models including decision tree, k-neighbors, naive Bayes, and random forest. By applying these techniques, we hope to identify patterns and relationships in the data, as well as make accurate predictions about future outcomes.

**Future Plans**

We will make our project code and documentation available on GitHub, where anyone can view our work and see our commitment to open-source practices. We also plan to create an mobile app based on this data mining to help diabetic patients make better healthcare decisions in the future.

We will use this project as an opportunity to learn and grow as data scientists and work towards building a successful career in this field.
Thank you for taking the time to review our project. We hope that you find our work as insightful. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or comments.
